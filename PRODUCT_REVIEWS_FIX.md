# 🔧 Product Reviews Fix

## ✅ ISSUE FIXED

**Error:** `Could not find a relationship between 'product_reviews' and 'profiles'`

**Cause:** The ProductReview component was trying to join with a `profiles` table that doesn't exist in the database.

---

## 🔧 SOLUTION APPLIED

### Before (Broken)
```tsx
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('product_reviews')
  .select(`
    *,
    user_profile:profiles!product_reviews_user_id_fkey(full_name, avatar_url),
    user_votes:review_helpful_votes!left(user_id, is_helpful)
  `)
```

**Problem:**
- Tried to join with non-existent `profiles` table
- Caused 400 Bad Request error
- Reviews wouldn't load

---

### After (Fixed)
```tsx
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('product_reviews')
  .select('*')
  .eq('product_id', productId)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false });

// Map reviews with anonymous user profiles
const reviewsWithProfiles = (data || []).map(review => ({
  ...review,
  user_profile: {
    full_name: `Customer ${review.user_id.slice(0, 8)}`,
    avatar_url: null
  },
  user_has_voted: false,
  user_vote_helpful: false
}));
```

**Solution:**
- Removed profiles table join
- Fetch only review data
- Generate anonymous customer names from user_id
- No database errors
