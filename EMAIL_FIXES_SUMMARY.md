  - Order flow continues even if email fails (non-blocking)

### 3. Status Update Email (Admin)
**File:** `src/pages/AdminOrders.tsx`
- **Problem:**

  - Emails only sent for "shipped" and "delivered" statuses
- **Fix:**

## Changes Made

### Modified Files
1. `supabase/config.toml` - Added send-order-status-update configuration
2. `src/pages/Checkout.tsx` - Added error handling for order confirmation emails
3. `src/pages/AdminOrders.tsx` - Added error handling and expanded status update emails

### New Files Created
1. `deploy-email-functions.ps1` - PowerShell script to deploy email functions
2. `EMAIL_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
3. `EMAIL_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Deploy the Functions
Run the deployment script:
```powershell
.\deploy-email-functions.ps1
```

This will deploy both email functions to your Supabase project.

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ngniknstgjpwgnyewpll/settings/functions
2. Ensure `RESEND_API_KEY` is set
3. The value should be your Resend API key (starts with `re_`)

### Step 3: Test the Functionality

#### Test Order Confirmation:
1. Place a test order
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for "Order confirmation email sent:" message
4. Check email inbox (and spam folder)

#### Test Status Update:
1. Go to Admin Orders page
2. Update an order status to "processing" or "shipped"
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Look for "Status update email sent:" message
5. Check customer's email inbox

## How It Works Now

### Order Confirmation Flow
```
Customer completes checkout
    ↓
Payment is processed
    ↓
Order is created in database
    ↓
Inventory is updated
    ↓
Email function is called (with error handling)
    ↓
    ├─ Success: Email sent, logged to console
    └─ Failure: Error logged, user notified, but order still succeeds
    ↓
Cart is cleared
    ↓
User redirected to orders page
```

### Status Update Flow
```
Admin updates order status
    ↓
Status is updated in database
    ↓
Status history entry is created
    ↓
If status is not "pending":
    ↓
    Email function is called (with error handling)
    ↓
    ├─ Success: Email sent, logged to console
    └─ Failure: Error logged, user notified, but status update still succeeds
    ↓
Admin sees success message
    ↓
Order list is refreshed
```

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Visibility:** You now see errors in the console when emails fail
2. **User Notification:** Users/admins get notified if emails don't send
3. **Non-Blocking:** Orders and status updates work even if email service is down
4. **More Notifications:** Customers get emails for all status changes (not just shipped/delivered)
5. **Better Debugging:** Detailed logs help identify issues quickly

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Check Browser Console
- Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab
- Look for email-related log messages
- Errors will be clearly marked

### Check Supabase Logs
- Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ngniknstgjpwgnyewpll/logs/edge-functions
- Filter by function name
- Look for errors or successful email IDs

### Check Resend Dashboard
- Go to: https://resend.com/emails
- See all sent emails and their status
- Check for delivery failures

## Common Issues

### "Email service not configured"
- **Cause:** RESEND_API_KEY not set
- **Fix:** Add it in Supabase Edge Functions settings

### "Email service unavailable"
- **Cause:** Invalid API key or Resend service issue
- **Fix:** Verify API key, check Resend dashboard

### Emails not received
- **Check:** Spam folder, domain verification, rate limits
- **Fix:** Verify domain in Resend, check quota

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Deploy the functions using the script
2. ✅ Verify RESEND_API_KEY is set
3. ✅ Test with a real order
4. ✅ Monitor logs for any issues
5. ⚠️ Consider verifying your domain in Resend for production
6. ⚠️ Update email templates with your branding if needed
