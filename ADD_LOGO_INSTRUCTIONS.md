# Adding Your Logo to The Style Yard

## ‚úÖ Code Updated

I've updated the following files to display your logo:

1. **Navigation.tsx** - Logo appears in the header next to "THE STYLE YARD"
2. **Footer.tsx** - Logo appears in the footer branding section

## üìÅ Save Your Logo

**IMPORTANT:** Save your logo image file as:

```
c:\Users\Bryan Joe\Documents\style-yard-emporium\public\logo.png
```

### Logo Specifications:
- **Format:** PNG (with transparent background recommended)
- **Size:** At least 200x200 pixels for best quality
- **Aspect Ratio:** Square (1:1) works best
- **File Name:** Must be exactly `logo.png`

## üé® Where Your Logo Appears

### 1. Navigation Header
- **Location:** Top left of every page
- **Size:** 40px √ó 40px (h-10 w-10)
- **Next to:** "THE STYLE YARD" text

### 2. Footer
- **Location:** Bottom of every page, brand section
- **Size:** 48px √ó 48px (h-12 w-12)
- **Next to:** "THE STYLE YARD" text

## üîÑ Optional: Update Favicon

You can also replace the favicon (browser tab icon):

1. Save a smaller version of your logo as:
   ```
   c:\Users\Bryan Joe\Documents\style-yard-emporium\public\favicon.ico
   ```
2. Recommended size: 32√ó32 or 64√ó64 pixels
3. Format: ICO or PNG

## üöÄ After Adding the Logo

1. **Save the logo file** to `public/logo.png`
2. **Refresh your browser** - The logo should appear immediately
3. **Check both locations:**
   - Navigation header (top of page)
   - Footer (bottom of page)

## üé® Customizing Logo Size

If you want to adjust the logo size, edit these files:

### Navigation Logo Size:
**File:** `src/components/Navigation.tsx`
**Line:** ~47
```tsx
className="h-10 w-10 object-contain"  // Change h-10 and w-10
```

### Footer Logo Size:
**File:** `src/components/Footer.tsx`
**Line:** ~15
```tsx
className="h-12 w-12 object-contain"  // Change h-12 and w-12
```

**Size Reference:**
- `h-8 w-8` = 32px √ó 32px (smaller)
- `h-10 w-10` = 40px √ó 40px (current nav)
- `h-12 w-12` = 48px √ó 48px (current footer)
- `h-16 w-16` = 64px √ó 64px (larger)

## ‚ú® Your Logo Design

Your elegant gold circular logo with the flowing "S" design will look beautiful alongside the text branding. The gold color matches perfectly with your premium-gold accent color scheme!

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Showing?
1. **Check file path:** Must be exactly `public/logo.png`
2. **Check file name:** Case-sensitive, must be lowercase
3. **Clear browser cache:** Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
4. **Check console:** Press F12 and look for 404 errors

### Logo Looks Stretched?
- Use `object-contain` class (already applied)
- Ensure your logo is square (same width and height)

### Logo Too Big/Small?
- Adjust the `h-` and `w-` classes as shown above
- Keep both values the same for square appearance
